# Homestead üè†

Welcome to **Homestead**, a monorepo that unites my personal portfolio and my family‚Äôs business websites. This repository is designed to provide a centralized, simple, and organized space for my digital projects.

## Contents

- **`portfolio/`**: My personal portfolio, showcasing my work, skills, and projects.
- **`marketing/`**: The marketing website for my family‚Äôs business, designed to attract customers and provide key business information.
- **`contact/`**: A contact page for the family business, making it easy for potential clients to reach out.

## Why "Homestead"?
